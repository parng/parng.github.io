Welcome recruiters.

I get a lot of unsolicited recruiter messages. <br>
To save both of our time, **I promise to reply to your message if you follow this guide.**

As of 2018, I am happy with my current role at Google.<br>
If you would like to contact me anyway, I am willing to consider opportunities that are:

 * Located in
   * San Francisco / Bay Area
   * Seattle
   * Sydney, Australia
   * Singapore
   * Bangkok, Thailand
 * Have user or social impact or purpose. Enterprise, finance, or for-business projects do not excite me.
 * Guarantee work/life balance

**Most importantly**, convince me why I should take you seriously.
Prove that you are taking this seriously and not sending the same message to thousands of people.
Tell me **which of my skills and experiences is relevant to your job opening**.

Once you have done that, send me either a LinkedIn message or an email to<br>
``recruiter@<this website domain without www>``.

If you follow the above guideline, I will try to response within a week.
Most likely, I will say
 * "Not interested, feel free to contact in [some duration]"<br>
   I'll keep you in mind if I ever start to look for opportunity.

 * "Not interested, please do not contact me again".<br>
   It's a role that I would never be interested in.

# Rules

 * **Respect my request not to be contacted.**<br>
   If you don't, I'll go the extra mile to block your entire organization.<br>
   <br>
 * **Do not email my @google.com address or my other email addresses.**<br>
   I consider such emails a breach of privacy.
   My @google.com address is also configured to block non @google.com emails.<br>
   <br>
 * **Do not send me LinkedIn or Facebook invites**<br>
   This falls under "are you taking this seriously".
   I will promptly decline and report invites as SPAM / "I do not know this person".<br>

 * **Do not contact me if you are a recruitment agency**<br>
   That is, you are not of the same organization/company as the job opening.<br>
   I cannot take you seriously that you have either me or your client company best interest in mind.
   You have every incentive to try and match as many people as possible.
