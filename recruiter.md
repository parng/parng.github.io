As of 2019, I am happy with my current role at Google.<br>
If you would like to contact me anyway, I am willing to consider opportunities that is located in:

   * San Francisco / Bay Area
   * Seattle
   * Sydney, Australia
   * Singapore
   * Bangkok, Thailand

Send me either a LinkedIn message or an email to<br>
``recruiter@<this website domain without www>``.

Other notes
 * **Do not email my @google.com address or my other email addresses.**<br>
   My @google.com address is also configured to block non @google.com emails.<br>

 * **Do not send me LinkedIn or Facebook invites**<br>
   I will promptly decline or report "I do not know this person".<br>
